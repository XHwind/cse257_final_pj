Repository for CSE257's Final Project

## Setup the environment

Please follow the original [sgm](https://github.com/XHwind/cse257_final_pj/tree/main/sgm) install instructions. And replace the `evaluation.py` and `planner.py` and `simple_navigation.py` with the one in the top folder. Those files are modified to support different functionality.
